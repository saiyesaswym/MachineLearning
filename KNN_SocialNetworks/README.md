The dataset is regarding the Social Network Advertisements. 

A set of 400 users are given to understand their behavior and to determine if they purchases a product displayed on the Social media advertisement. Different parameters like Sex, Age and Salary of each user are given. 

The task is to determine if the user makes a purchase (1) or not (0).

KNN (K-nearest neighbors) algorithm is used in this case. The algorithm is implemented in Python using Scikit-learn library.

The output is displayed in the form of graphs for both train data and test data.
